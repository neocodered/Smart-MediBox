# Smart-MediBox
### Smart Medibox Project Overview

The Smart Medibox project was undertaken as part of the EN2853 Embedded Systems and Applications module. The project was divided into two distinct stages:

**Stage 1: Simulation on Wokwi Platform**
- Created a simulated medibox on the Wokwi platform.
- Features included setting and canceling alarms, adjusting time zones, and issuing alerts for unfavorable temperature or humidity conditions.
- Utilized an OLED screen for display and a buzzer for audible alerts.
- Provided a comprehensive simulation environment for effective medication storage management.

**Stage 2: Internet Integration with MQTT and Node-RED**
- Integrated the medibox with the internet using MQTT protocol and Node-RED.
- Enabled real-time monitoring and control via a web interface.
- Displayed temperature and light intensity data online.
- Included a sliding window mechanism to regulate light entering the box, controlled through the web interface.
- Automatically adjusted light intensity based on the type of medicine selected online, ensuring optimal storage conditions.

**Summary**

The Smart Medibox project, part of the EN2853 module, progressed through simulation on the Wokwi platform to real-time internet integration. Initially, it provided functionalities like alarms and environmental alerts using an OLED screen and buzzer. In the second stage, it leveraged MQTT and Node-RED for web-based monitoring and control, including a smart sliding window for regulating light based on medication requirements, thus enhancing medication preservation.
